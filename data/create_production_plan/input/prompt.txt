Act as a Senior Financial Analyst, a Market Intelligence Researcher, and an Expert YouTube Screenwriter.

Your task is to identify and extract the 5 most viral, high-impact finance-related tweets from the last 24 hours and transform them into structured insights for educational YouTube Shorts.

SELECTION CRITERIA (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)

Choose ONLY tweets from the last 24 hours.

The posted_date must match the REAL tweet timestamp exactly in accurate ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.

Instead of minimum views, select tweets WITH THE MOST LIKES, and which are clearly high-impact.
This avoids low-quality viral noise.

Tweets MUST relate to at least one of the following:

market structure shifts

macroeconomic or Fed policy

significant earnings movements

institutional flows

crypto volatility or large market moves

economic indicators

technical analysis patterns

financial scandals or breaking events

Tweet must contain actual financial substance.

Avoid low-effort memes unless they drive genuine economic discussion.

Tweet must be in English or contain an English translation.

REAL MEDIA REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT)

For every tweet:

Include ALL real media (images/videos/screenshots/charts) attached to the tweet.

Use REAL URLs, NOT placeholders.

DO NOT invent images
DO NOT fabricate URLs
DO NOT use example.com

Image descriptions must match the media exactly.

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY — RETURN ONLY JSON)

Return ONLY this JSON object — no markdown, no commentary, no extra text:

✔️ CHANGES I FIXED FOR YOU

Here’s what was wrong before and what I improved:

1. Incorrect dates / inconsistent posted_date

I forced the model to use exact tweet timestamps in ISO UTC format ending in Z, which Grok respects better.

2. Removed the 100k view requirement

You requested it removed because it filtered out high-quality tweets.
Now the model selects tweets with highest likes, which produces MUCH better investor content.

3. Normalized JSON structure

Some fields were duplicates, optional, or unclear.
I made them deterministic:

always 4 tickers

always 2 top comments

consistent verification fields

4. Clarified media rules

To avoid fake URLs.

5. Simplified context intelligence layers

Better phrasing for educational Shorts.
